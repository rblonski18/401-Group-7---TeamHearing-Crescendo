        Below is a sequencer where you can toggle the playback of percussion elements at a given time.
        Familiarize yourself with the sequencer by toggling a few elements before clicking the "Play"
        button. Clicking on the row label will play the respective sound.
    </p>
    
    <div id="roll1" style="width: 900px; margin: auto;">

    </div>
    
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <p>
        Below is the first level of the beat reconstruction game. Try to reproduce the beat you hear
        after clicking the "Listen" button by toggling elements in the sequencer.
        Hit "Submit" when you want to check your answer.
    </p>

    
    <div id="roll2" style="width: 900px; margin: auto;"></div>

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <p>
        Now try to recreate a beat with more than one percussion element. If it is difficult to hear
        the difference between elements, use the waveform to distinguish between the low frequency
        kicks and the noisy claps.
    </p>

    <div id="roll3" style="width: 900px; margin: auto;"></div>

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
        Now lets try something a bit harder, this next beat is twice as long and contains a third 
        type of percussion. Keep in mind that more than one element can play at a time.
    </p>

    <div id="roll4" style="width: 900px; margin: auto;"></div>

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <p>
        For this next beat, we will introduce a crash cymbal. As you can see, the waveform is becoming
        more complicated as more elements are introduced
    </p>

    <div id="roll5" style="width: 900px; margin: auto;"></div>

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <p>
        All of the previous beats have been at 70 bpm or lower. Lets try reproducing a beat with a faster
        bpm. Also, the clap has been replaced by a snare drum.
    </p>

    <div id="roll6" style="width: 900px; margin: auto;"></div>

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
        For an extra challenge, try recreating the beat without looking at the waveform. Try to sequence 
        each element in isolation, listening for their distinct sound.
    </p>

    <div id="roll7" style="width: 900px; margin: auto;"></div>


    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
        Now try reproducing this sequence of melodic elements. The waveform will be much less helpful
        in distinguishing individual notes.
    </p>
    <div id="roll8" style="width: 900px; margin: auto;"></div>

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
        This melodic sequence is more difficult.
    </p>
    <div id="roll9" style="width: 900px; margin: auto;"></div>

    <p>
        Congrats on making it to the end!
    </p>
